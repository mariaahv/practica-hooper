    <p><strong> Grace Brewster Murray Hopper </strong>(née <strong>Murray</strong>; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was
        an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer scientist </a>
        and United States Navy rear admiral.[1] <mark>One of the
        first programmers of the Harvard</mark> Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer
        programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized
        the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" target="_blank">COBOL</a>,an early
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language" target="_blank">high-level programming language</a>
         still in use today. </p>
    <p> Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was
        rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist.
        She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career when she
        worked on the Harvard Mark . I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949,
        she joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert%E2%80%93Mauchly_Computer_Corporation" target="_blank">
          Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation</a> and was part of the development
        team that designed the UNIVAC I computer in 1944. It was at Eckert–Mauchly that she
        began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in
        English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler
        would convert that code into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code" target="_blank"> machine code</a>
         that would be understood by computers.
        By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for the A-0 System programming language.</p>

    <p> In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the
        release of some of the first compiled languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC" target="_blank">
          FLOW-MATIC</a>. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL
        consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language.
        This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words.
        In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired
        from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" target="_blank">
          Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, sharing her
        computing experiences.</p>

    <p>Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".
        The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was
        the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.[8] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary
        degrees from universities across the world. In 1991, she received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Technology_and_Innovation"
        target="_blank">National Medal of Technology</a>.
        On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" target="_blank">
          Presidential Medal of Freedom </a>by President<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" target="_blank">  Barack Obama</a>.</p>
